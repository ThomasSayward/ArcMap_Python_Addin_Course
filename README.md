# ArcMap_Python_Addin_Course
An educational version on how to create a simple python Addin for ArcMap. This project is ideal for those wanting to learn how to develop a python addin, but have limited to no exposure writing code. To follow this exercise no previous programming experience is necessary. Students will create a simple one button addin, that when clicked will take the current date time stamp, along with the file path of the mxd and write it to a .csv & .txt file.

This project contains a zip file of ESRI's python addin wizard, which can be individually downloaded from https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=5f3aefe77f6b4f61ad3e4c62f30bff3b
